        <p>For the circuit, I used Red, Green and Yellow LEDs.
          I used a resistance of 220 Ohm for each LED because after 
          doing the calculations, I found that the maximum Resistance I would need is 
          160 ohms. 220 was the closest standard resistance value.

        <p>
          Red, Yellow and Green all needed a minimum of 160 Ohm.
        </p>

    The resistors used for each LED are 220 Ohm. The exact resistance needed was 160 Ohm, and the closest to that was 220 Ohm.

        <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
        1. <img src="Graph.jpeg" alt="Graph of Voltage across LEDs">
        <br>
        2. We should have been able to connect 14 LEDs at the same time since the Arduino has 14 pins. But 14 x 20mA = 280mA which is greater than the maximum limit of 200mA. So in reality, we will be able to connect 10 LEDs to the Arduino at the same time.
        <br>
        4. I had to reduce the time between blinks to 10ms until I could no longer tell they were blinking.

        <h1>PlantPal: Final Project Proposal</h1>
        
        <h2>Project Concept/Motivation</h2>
        <p>I want to build a Plant Monitoring System, designed to help users take better care of their houseplants by providing real-time environmental feedback. Using sensors for soil moisture, light levels, and temperature, the system will detect whether the plant needs watering, more sunlight, or a temperature adjustment. The user will receive instant feedback through an RGB LED and LCD display, which will show sensor readings and status messages.</p>
        <p>I want to make this because I have killed every houseplant I’ve tried raising.</p>
        
        <h2>Anticipated Bill of Materials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>RGB LED (to display status of conditions - red for bad, etc.)</li>
            <li>LCD screen (to display plant status)</li>
            <li>Moisture sensor (for soil moisture sensing)</li>
            <li>Thermistor (for temperature sensing)</li>
            <li>Photoresistor (for light sensing)</li>
            <li>Assorted resistors (for current-limiting)</li>
            <li>A houseplant (for tinkering with)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Timeline and Contingency Plans</h2>
        <p>In Week 1, I will finalize the design, gather materials, and test individual sensor readings for soil moisture (sensor TBD), light (photoresistor), and temperature (thermistor). Once the sensors are working, I will integrate the LCD display to show sensor values and plant status messages.</p>
        <p>In Week 2, I will add a LED indicator system (Green = healthy, Yellow = needs attention, Red = critical) and refine the logic to ensure accurate feedback. By mid-week, I will assemble the system into an enclosure or attach it to a plant pot, ensuring it is fully integrated as a product rather than just a breadboard setup. The final days will be spent on testing, debugging, and making refinements before preparing the presentation and submission.</p>
        <p>One challenge is determining the best method for sensing soil moisture. If I can’t find a reliable solution, I will shift my focus to using a capacitive touch sensor that triggers watering in the plant when touched.</p>
